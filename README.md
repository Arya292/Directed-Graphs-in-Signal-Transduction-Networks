# Directed-Graphs-in-Signal-Transduction-Networks

Signal transduction is the process by which a chemical or physical signal is transmitted through a cell as a series of molecular events. Signal transduction helps to control and maintain normal physiological balance within the body which includes cellular growth, cell death and metabolism. Signal transduction therapy has become one of the most important areas of modern drug research, which includes cancer, infectious diseases, inflammation, neurodegenerative disorders. When signaling pathways interact with one another they form networks, which allow cellular responses to be coordinated. Signal transduction can be said as an application of directed graphs. Here we have used directed graph to illustrate the dataset we have made from different Signal transduction networks. The graph will provide us an overview that how the transduction happens and through what all steps. The pathway of network is illustrated to form an idea how directed graphs can be used in network analysis of signal transduction.
